 Accounts and authorization
============================

--------
Accounts
--------
Social Feed Manager allows users to self-sign up for accounts.
Those accounts are stored and managed by SFM. Future versions of SFM may
support authentication against external systems, e.g., Shibboleth.

Because creating accounts is not restricted, it is encouraged to take
other measures to secure SFM such as restricting access to the IP range
of your institution.

------
Groups
------
By default, a group is created for each user and the user is placed in
group. To create additional groups and modify group membership use
the Admin interface.

In general, users and groups can be administered from the Admin interface.

--------------
Authorizations
--------------
A collection set is owned by a group. The members of that group can administer
the collection set and all of its collections. Thus, to enable a team to
collaborate on a collection set, create a group that includes all of the team
members and assign ownership of the team to the group.

When the visibility on a collection is set to "Other users" then any user
that is logged into SFM can view the collection and request an export.
(The user cannot make a change to the collection.)

A user that is designated as staff can view all collections.

A user that is designated as a superuser can administer all collections.
